  <p>ðŸš¨ SPECIAL MONDAY NIGHT WK9 RANKINGS ðŸš¨ *I felt it was fair to jump the gun since the only matchup still up for grabs is between the 2 tanking teams*</p>
	<p>1.	Marco (1st)</p>
        <p>Yes heâ€™s 4-4. Yes I just took him down. But that speaks more to Eagle Fangâ€™s storied resilience rather than the lack of talent on Marcoâ€™s team. Heâ€™s still utterly loaded and the favorite to win it all IMO.</p>
	<p>2.	Weezy (9th)</p>
       <p>Thru 1.5 years Iâ€™ve learned 1 thing. Sam always finds a way to win (except this week but weâ€™ll get to Cam). Weezy has casually added the starting RBs from the 2 SB favorites. Any question I had regarding his depth has gone out the window and heâ€™s very much a threat to take the first 2 years of this league.</p>
	<p>3.	Tim (2nd)</p>
        <p>Kenneth Walker and Etienne stock have moonshotted and itâ€™s really fast tracked Timâ€™s squad. Higgins also getting a bump these next weeks. Heâ€™s nipping at Marcoâ€™s heels for best long-term roster and I think the playoff favorites are really starting to solidify. I will continue to root against Waddle for the rest of his career.</p>
	<p>4.	Cam (10th)</p>
       <p>217 points is going to get my attention. He may be addicted to mortgaging his future. But I canâ€™t argue with the fact that adding Mclaurin and Cooks can only help this year. Absolutely no one has more riding on this season and that level of commitment is bound to make things interesting.</p>
	<p>5.	Swarsh (4th)</p>
        <p>No Chase is really going to test this roster. First week: 70pts. Playoff spots are running out quick and every W is becoming precious. This could be a team on the outside looking in.</p>
	<p>6.	Me (3rd)</p>
      <p> Just when Iâ€™m ready to waive the white flag, my boys come out with their performance of the year. I canâ€™t quit these guys, and while we may not possess the talent today as some rosters above us, thereâ€™s just something about this groupâ€¦</p>
	<p>7.	Bryant (7th)</p>
        <p>Bryguy is cruising to 5-3 and it turns out heâ€™s been keeping receipts along the way. The mere fact Iâ€™m ranking him 7th could propel him to continue this 4 game win streak, but Iâ€™m not one to overreact. This is how I feel about his guys and I hope he proves me wrong.</p>
	<p>8.	Staley (6th)</p>
 <p> I donâ€™t know what I ever saw in this team. One of my biggest failures. This is more the range he belongs. His WRâ€™s just arenâ€™t ready. Couldnâ€™t be more clear to me now.</p>
<p>9.	Langdon (5th)</p>
<p>Heâ€™s pushed all his chips in for a tank. While he may have punted his chances for this year, you canâ€™t deny heâ€™s building a nice war chest for future years. Was Staley just a beta Langdon this whole time?</p>
<p>10.	Bayern (8th)</p>
<p>After a short blip on the radar, Bayern is back where he belongs. Even so, he does have a few blue chip assets and TBH way more in the mix than what I thought he would be. Iâ€™m also just salty cause Bayern keeps beating me in madden.</p>
